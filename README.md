<ul type="disc">
    <li>This project is a functional and interactive Todo application built using React, with features such as task creation, filtering, drag-and-drop functionality, and local storage integration. It allows users to create, mark as completed, filter tasks by completion status and repeat frequency (daily/weekly), and drag-and-drop tasks to reorder them.</li>
    <li>The application features task repeat functionality based on daily or weekly intervals. Users can filter tasks by their completion status or their repeat frequency. A user-friendly interface is designed to handle tasks on both desktop and mobile devices, providing an interactive and smooth experience.</li>

        <ol type="1">        
            <li>React Components Structure:</li>
            <ul type="circle">
                <li>The project is built using React, where different components handle specific parts of the Todo app.</li>
                <li>Components include TodoList, TodoItem, TaskInput, and Filters, each managing their own state and logic.</li>
                <li>useState and useEffect hooks are used for state management, ensuring smooth updates and rendering.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Tailwind CSS Styling:</li>
            <ul type="circle">
                <li>Tailwind CSS is used for styling, providing a clean and modern design using utility-first classes.</li>
                <li>The design is responsive, adjusting seamlessly across mobile and desktop views.</li>
                <li>Hover effects and transitions are applied to interactive elements for better user experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Task Management Functionality:</li>
            <ul type="circle">
                <li>Users can add tasks, edit tasks, and mark them as completed or delete tasks.</li>
                <li>Tasks have properties like title, description, and repeat frequency (daily/weekly).</li>
                <li>When tasks are marked complete, they get a visual indicator and can be toggled back to incomplete.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Task Filtering and Sorting:</li>
            <ul type="circle">
                <li>Tasks can be filtered based on completion status: All, Completed, or Incomplete.</li>
                <li>Users can filter tasks by their repeat frequency (Daily, Weekly, or All).</li>
                <li>Sorting tasks helps users find and prioritize their tasks based on their status or frequency.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Drag-and-Drop Task Reordering:</li>
            <ul type="circle">
                <li>The app allows drag-and-drop functionality to reorder tasks, enabling easy organization.</li>
                <li>Users can simply drag tasks to different positions on the list for dynamic adjustments.</li>
                <li>Visual feedback during dragging ensures a smooth and intuitive reordering experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Local Storage Integration:</li>
            <ul type="circle">
                <li>Task data is stored in local storage, ensuring tasks persist across browser sessions.</li>
                <li>Changes (add, edit, delete) are automatically saved to local storage, and data is loaded on app initialization.</li>
                <li>This feature makes sure users don‚Äôt lose their tasks even if they close the browser or refresh the page.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Responsive User Interface:</li>
            <ul type="circle">
                <li>The app‚Äôs layout is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes using Tailwind‚Äôs grid system.</li>
                <li>The design maintains usability and readability on both mobile and desktop devices.</li>
                <li>Interactive elements like buttons and filters adjust in size and positioning based on screen width.</li>
            </ul>
    </ol>
